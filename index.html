			<p class="project-body">Elevate, an all in one fitness app, was designed to create better experiences for new and fresh people starting their fitness journeys. Since the fitness industry is booming, and Reebok turned a different direction with their rebrand to cele-brate the everyday person, I wanted to create a fitness app that was designed for experienced and inexperienced users.</p>

			<p class="project-body">One of the projects that I was tasked to work on at DoubleDoor Technologies was to ideate and design the negotiation system between buyers and sellers within the website. The sprint lasted 2 weeks and involved designing the dashboard, experience of making an offer, and the counter offer experience.</p>

			<h1 class="about-title">ABOUT ME</h1>
			<p class="about-me-info">As a child up until my senior year of college, I always wanted to work in a field that involved helping others. A superhero in first grade, a firefighter after discovering the concept of fiction, then settled on becoming an occupational therapist throughout my first two years of college. Volunteering over at numerous medical facilities throughout my college years, I finally accepted the realization that this was not a career I wanted to pursue. At the age of 21, I discovered the world of design. As I gained a better understanding of design and the influence it has on people, society, and the world; my interest in the field sparked. I dove right in. I chose to pursue interaction design because I want to help, yes I might not be helping the same way a superhero, firefighter, or therapist would, but I am helping humans interact and communicate with the products they use in their daily life. </p>
